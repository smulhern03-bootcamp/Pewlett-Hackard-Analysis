Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  Yes, however each mentor would need approximately 2-3 mentees.  There are 57,104 staff and 66,422 enginners born between 1956 and 1966.  That equates to approximately 2.5 mentees per senior engineer and 2.3 mentees per senior staffer.

The company has zero employees born after 1965 and has not hired any employees since 2000.  Therefore, the youngest employee is 59 as of 13 SEPT 2020.  The most junior employee has been with the company for approximately 20 years.

Allow the 1952-1955 employees to retire and have the younger (1965) senior employees mentor the junior employees.  Based upon a query of the staff born in 1965, 466 hold a position as Engineer or Assistant engineer.  These are deemd "junior-level" positions.
