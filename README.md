# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

The company has a large number of employees were are reaching, or have reached, retirement age.  The company wants to understand the logistical situation of this "silver tsunami" and whether a mentorship program is feasible based upon the number of retirement aged employees relative to their younger colleagues.  This analysis will look at those who are at the age of retirement (1952-1955) and conduct an analysis of their positions and how many otherly aged employees exist within the company.  It will then answer two major questions: how many roles will be vacant due to retirements and are there enough retirement-ready employees to establish a mentorship program for the remaining employees?

## Analysis

1. The organization is top-heavy with almost twice as many Senior-level employees compared to junior-level former and current employees - 57,668 vs. 32,728 respectively, that could be considered retirement aged (born between 1952 and 1955).

2. Of the 57,668 current and former Senior-level employees, 25,916 current senior engineers were born between 1952-1955, and 24,926 senior staff were born in that same time frame.  These individuals are still with the company.  This results in the youngest senior-level employee being four months shy of 65.

3. The most recent promotion to a Senior-level position, defined as a position with Senior in the title, was 18 MAY 2002.  In 18 years, no other individual has been promoted to a higher position within the organization.

4. Only 703 of the senior-level positions are held by an individual born in 1965.  There are a total of 1549 employess born in 1965


## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?  Assuming all the "silver tsunami" will retire, there will be approximately 50,842 positions available.  

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?  Yes, however each mentor would need approximately 2-3 mentees.  There are 57,104 staff and 66,422 enginners born between 1956 and 1966.  That equates to approximately 2.5 mentees per senior engineer and 2.3 mentees per senior staffer.  Another option would be to allow the 1952-1955 employees to retire and have the younger (1965) senior employees mentor the junior employees.  Based upon a query of the staff born in 1965, 466 hold a position as Engineer or Assistant engineer.  These are deemed "junior-level" positions.  There are 245 senior-level employees of that same birth year.

The company has zero employees born after 1965 and has not hired any employees since 2000.  Therefore, the youngest employee is 59 as of 13 SEPT 2020.  The most junior employee has been with the company for approximately 20 years.  Once the "silver tsunami" begins, the company is urged to begin hiring younger individuals to fill positions vacant due to retirement or promotion.  As stated, the youngest employee is 59.  If these individuals choose 65 as their retirement age, the company has six years to hire younger individuals before another "silver tsunami" hits, assuming the first one stopped.
